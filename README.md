# Javascript Projects

It consists a collection of my javascript projects. The projects weren't big enough for an individual repo so I combined them in a single repo.

For more info regarding a specific project, navigate to that project's directory and check out its readme file.

## Here are the live previews of all the projects:

1. [Multiplication Table](https://multiplicationtable-dk.netlify.app/)
2. [Countdown App](https://countdowntimer-dk.netlify.app/)
3. [Mind Relaxer App](https://mindrelaxer-dk.netlify.app/)
4. [Music App](https://musicapp-dk.netlify.app/)
5. [Javascript Clock](https://javascriptclock-dk.netlify.app/)
