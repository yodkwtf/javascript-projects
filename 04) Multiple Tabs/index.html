              Test cricket is the form of the sport of cricket with the longest
              match duration, and is considered the game's highest standard.
              Test matches are played between national representative teams that
              have been granted Test status, as determined and conferred by the
              International Cricket Council (ICC). The term Test stems from the
              fact that the long, gruelling matches are mentally and physically
              testing. Two teams of 11 players each play a four-innings match,
              which may last up to five days (or longer in some historical
              cases). It is generally considered the most complete examination
              of a team's endurance and ability.

            <!-- odi matches -->
            <p class="info-text" id="odi">
              Limited overs cricket, also known as one-day cricket, is a version
              of the sport of cricket in which a match is generally completed in
              one day, which includes List A cricket and Twenty20 cricket. The
              name reflects the rule that in the match each team bowls a set
              maximum number of overs, usually between 20 and 50, although
              shorter and longer forms of limited overs cricket have been
              played. The concept contrasts with Test and first-class matches,
              which can take up to five days to complete. One-day cricket is
              popular with spectators as it can encourage aggressive, risky,
              entertaining batting, often results in cliffhanger endings, and
              ensures that a spectator can watch an entire match without
              committing to five days of continuous attendance.

            <!-- t-20 matches -->
            <p class="info-text" id="t-20">
              Twenty20 cricket or Twenty-20 (often abbreviated to T20), is a
              shortened format of cricket. At the professional level, it was
              originally introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)
              in 2003 for the inter-county competition. In a Twenty20 game, the
              two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a
              maximum of 20 overs. Together with first-class and List A cricket,
              Twenty20 is one of the three current forms of cricket recognised
              by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as being at the highest
              international or domestic level.
